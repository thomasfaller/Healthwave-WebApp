# Healthwave-WebApp
WebApp design for Healthwave.

Q3. WebApp Design


Create a simple web interface that 
contains 
A search box
A “submit” button
A results table/grid area
An “Add” button (optional - if you have time)

Performs the following functions
A user can type a medicine name and click submit
The submit action looks up the medicine in a MySQL table and retrieves the medicine
The result is printed in the results table area (medicine, pack size and price)
Allows for more than one search result to be appended to the results table
Where the user adds more than one result to the results table, the table should display a total price under the price column
The “add” button should display a modal form that allows a user to save a new medicine to the database. (optional - if you have time)
Publish to Github 
Tools for Q3
UI
The web interface should use HTML, CSS and JS.

You may also use a framework you are comfortable with e.g. Bootstrap.js, React.js, Angular.js
Database
Create a mySQL database with a table called “medicines”

Add the following data
 
id
product_name
pack_size
price
1
Paracetamol
100
4.95
2
Atorvastatin
28
6.95
3
Ramipril
28
9.95

Server-Side
You will ideally use PHP for your server-side script to send responses to the UI.

JS server-side code will also be accepted e.g. node.js
Gtihub

Publish your solution on Gtihub and include the URL as your answer.
